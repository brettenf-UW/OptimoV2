# OptimoV2 Optimization Failure Analysis Results

## Executive Summary

After thorough investigation of the failed optimization job (`optimo-job-71e33b45-8b4a-4897-a2c8-728a9299a1b4`), I identified **two critical bugs** that are causing all optimization jobs to fail:

1. **Missing Script Error**: The container attempts to run `/app/scripts/run_pipeline.py` but fails with "No such file or directory"
2. **Import Error**: The `run_batch_job_updated.py` script imports a non-existent class `OptimizationPipeline` (should be `PipelineRunner`)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Script Execution Failure
The container v6 currently deployed is failing because:
```
Pipeline failed: python: can't open file '/app/scripts/run_pipeline.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

### Secondary Issue: Code Bug
The `run_batch_job_updated.py` script has a critical bug at line 123:
```python
from src.pipeline.runner import OptimizationPipeline  # This class doesn't exist!
```

The correct class name is `PipelineRunner`, not `OptimizationPipeline`.

### Additional Issues Found

1. **AWS Region Not Specified**: Boto3 clients in `run_batch_job_updated.py` don't specify region
2. **Container Build Process**: The `rebuild_container.sh` overwrites the working script with the buggy version
3. **Environment Variables**: While initially suspected, the environment variables are correctly passed from Lambda to Batch

## Timeline of Failure

1. Job starts successfully
2. Container launches and begins execution
3. Downloads input files from S3 successfully (~1-2 minutes)
4. Attempts to run optimization pipeline
5. Fails when trying to execute `/app/scripts/run_pipeline.py` 
6. Job exits after ~3 minutes with "Essential container in task exited"

## Solution Implemented

I've created three key files to fix the issues:

### 1. `diagnose_optimo.sh`
A comprehensive diagnostic tool that checks:
- Docker images and ECR status
- AWS configuration and permissions
- S3 bucket accessibility
- Batch job definitions
- Local file integrity
- Python dependencies
- Known issues

### 2. `fix_optimo_now.sh`
An emergency fix script that:
- Backs up existing scripts
- Applies the fixed version of `run_batch_job.py`
- Rebuilds the container as v7
- Pushes to ECR
- Creates a new job definition `optimo-job-def-v7`
- Provides clear next steps

### 3. `scripts/run_batch_job_fixed.py`
A corrected version that:
- Uses subprocess to run `run_pipeline.py` (like the original)
- Specifies AWS region for all boto3 clients
- Handles Gurobi license retrieval properly
- Downloads files from the correct S3 location
- Provides better error handling and logging

## Immediate Action Required

To fix the optimization system, run these commands:

```bash
# 1. Run diagnostic to see current state
./diagnose_optimo.sh

# 2. Apply the fix and rebuild container
./fix_optimo_now.sh

# 3. Update Lambda to use new job definition
# Edit lambda/unified_handler.py line ~108:
# Change: 'jobDefinition': 'optimo-job-def',
# To:     'jobDefinition': 'optimo-job-def-v7',

# 4. Deploy updated Lambda
cd lambda
./deploy_unified.sh
```

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix:

1. Submit a test job through the frontend
2. Monitor CloudWatch logs for the new job
3. Verify the job progresses past the 3-minute mark
4. Check that output files are uploaded to S3

## Prevention Recommendations

1. **Testing**: Always test container builds locally before deployment
2. **Version Control**: Don't overwrite working scripts during builds
3. **Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch alarms for job failures
4. **Documentation**: Keep container version history updated
5. **Validation**: Add pre-deployment checks for critical imports

## Technical Details

### Container Entry Point Flow
1. Lambda submits job with environment variables
2. Container starts with `python /app/scripts/run_batch_job.py`
3. Script downloads files from S3
4. Script runs `python /app/scripts/run_pipeline.py` via subprocess
5. Pipeline executes optimization iterations
6. Results uploaded to S3

### File Structure Requirements
```
/app/
├── scripts/
│   ├── run_batch_job.py      # Entry point
│   └── run_pipeline.py       # Main pipeline script
├── src/
│   ├── pipeline/
│   │   └── runner.py         # Contains PipelineRunner class
│   └── ...
└── config/
    └── settings.yaml
```

## Summary

The optimization failures were caused by a combination of a missing script error and a code bug introduced during recent updates. The fix involves correcting the import statement and rebuilding the container with the proper script execution method. Once the fix is applied and the Lambda is updated to use the new job definition, optimization jobs should complete successfully.
