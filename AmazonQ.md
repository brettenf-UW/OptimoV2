# OptimoV2 AWS Deployment Progress

## Step 1: S3 Buckets Setup ✅

Successfully created the following resources:

- S3 bucket for input files: `optimo-input-files` in region `us-west-2`
- S3 bucket for output files: `optimo-output-files` in region `us-west-2`
- CORS configuration for the input bucket to allow requests from GitHub Pages

Created configuration file at `/mnt/c/dev/OptimoV2/config/aws_config.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "region": "us-west-2",
  "buckets": {
    "input": "optimo-input-files",
    "output": "optimo-output-files"
  },
  "api": {
    "baseUrl": "https://ppwbzsy1bh.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: IAM Roles and Budget Setup ✅

Successfully created the following resources:

- Budget alert set to $50/month with notifications at 80% and 100%
- IAM roles with appropriate permissions:
  - `optimo-lambda-role` for Lambda functions
  - `optimo-batch-role` for AWS Batch jobs
- Custom IAM policies:
  - `optimo-lambda-policy` with permissions for S3, DynamoDB, and Batch
  - `optimo-batch-policy` with permissions for S3 and DynamoDB

## Step 3: DynamoDB Table Setup ✅

Successfully created the following resources:

- DynamoDB table `optimo-jobs` with `jobId` as the primary key
- Pay-per-request billing mode to minimize costs

## Step 4: Docker Image for AWS Batch ✅

Created the following resources:

- Dockerfile with Python 3.9 and Gurobi optimization library
- Batch job script (`run_batch_job.py`) that:
  - Downloads input files from S3
  - Runs the optimization process
  - Uploads results back to S3
  - Updates job status in DynamoDB
- ECR repository `optimo-batch` for storing the Docker image

## Step 5: Configure AWS Batch ✅

Successfully created the following resources:

- Compute environment `optimo-compute-env`:
  - Using c5.24xlarge instances (96 vCPUs, 192GB RAM)
  - Spot instances with capacity-optimized allocation
  - Auto-scaling from 0 to 96 vCPUs
- Job queue `optimo-job-queue`
- Job definition `optimo-job`:
  - 96 vCPUs and 140GB memory allocation
  - 3-minute checkpointing for resilience
  - 65-minute timeout
  - 2 retry attempts

## Step 6: Create Lambda Functions ✅

Successfully created the following Lambda functions:

- `optimo-upload-handler`: Generates presigned URLs for uploading files to S3
- `optimo-job-submission`: Submits jobs to AWS Batch and tracks them in DynamoDB
- `optimo-job-status`: Checks the status of jobs in AWS Batch and DynamoDB
- `optimo-results-handler`: Generates presigned URLs for downloading results from S3

## Step 7: Create API Gateway ✅

Successfully created the following API Gateway resources:

- REST API: `optimo-api`
- Endpoints:
  - POST /upload: Get presigned URL for file upload
  - POST /jobs: Submit a new optimization job
  - GET /jobs/{jobId}/status: Check job status
  - GET /jobs/{jobId}/results: Get job results
- Deployed to production stage
- API URL: https://ppwbzsy1bh.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod

## Step 8: Frontend Integration ✅

Successfully updated the frontend to integrate with the AWS backend:

- Created a configuration file to import AWS settings
- Updated API service to use the AWS API Gateway endpoints
- Implemented presigned URL workflow for file uploads:
  1. Request presigned URL from API Gateway
  2. Upload file directly to S3 using the presigned URL
  3. Submit job with file references
- Updated job status checking to use the new API endpoints
- Implemented result downloading using presigned URLs

### Frontend Build and Deployment

To build and deploy the frontend:

1. Ensure the AWS configuration is correctly set up in `config/aws_config.json`
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd optimo-frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Build the production version:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the API endpoints** with sample data
2. **Monitor costs** and performance
3. **Set up CloudWatch alarms** for error monitoring
4. **Consider implementing authentication** for API Gateway
