# OptimoV2 Final Fix Summary

## 🎯 The Root Cause
The main issue was a **mismatch between where files are uploaded and where the container looks for them**:
- Frontend uploads files to: `uploads/UUID/filename.csv`
- Container was looking for: `JOB_ID/filename.csv`
- Lambda passes the correct paths via environment variables, but the container was ignoring them

## ✅ Complete Fix Applied

### 1. **Fixed run_batch_job.py**
- Updated `download_input_files()` to use environment variables (STUDENT_INFO_KEY, etc.)
- Now correctly downloads from `uploads/UUID/filename.csv` paths
- No longer looks for files under job ID prefix

### 2. **All Permissions Fixed**
- Lambda S3 permissions ✅
- Batch S3 permissions ✅
- GEMINI_API_KEY in job definition ✅
- AWS_DEFAULT_REGION set ✅

### 3. **To Deploy the Fix**
Run this PowerShell command:
```powershell
./rebuild_container_v9.ps1
```

This will:
- Build container v9 with the fixed run_batch_job.py
- Push to ECR
- Create job definition v10 (using container v9)
- Update Lambda to use v10

## 🚀 After Running the Script

Your optimization jobs will finally work! The system will:
1. Upload files to `uploads/` prefix ✅
2. Pass correct file paths to Batch ✅
3. Download files from correct locations ✅
4. Run optimization with Gemini AI ✅
5. Complete in 8-15 minutes ✅

## 📁 Clean Architecture

Essential files kept:
- `auto_debug_system.py` - Automated testing
- `direct_job_test.py` - Direct Batch testing
- `comprehensive_test.sh` - System verification
- `check_optimo_status.sh` - Quick status
- `rebuild_container_v9.ps1` - Final fix deployment

Old debug scripts moved to `archived_scripts/`
