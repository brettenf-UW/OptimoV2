You are a school registrar optimizing class sections.

CURRENT SITUATION:
{summary_stats}

SECTIONS NEEDING ACTION:
{problem_sections}

ALL SECTIONS BY COURSE:
{course_context}

TEACHER LOADS:
{teacher_loads}

DEPARTMENT SUMMARY:
{department_summary}

YOUR GOAL: Ensure ALL sections have 70%-110% utilization. NO EXCEPTIONS.

IMPORTANT: Any section below 70% MUST be fixed, even if it's at 66% or 69%. Don't ignore them!

CRITICAL RULES:
- Any section below 70% utilization is UNACCEPTABLE and must be fixed.
- Any section above 110% utilization is DANGEROUS and must be split or have new sections added.
- ONE ACTION PER COURSE: You may only perform ONE action (split, merge, add, or remove) per course per iteration.
- BE STRATEGIC: Consider the total course capacity and demand before making decisions.
- CHECK TEACHER LOADS: Ensure teachers have capacity before adding sections.
- ALWAYS TAKE ACTION: If sections are outside 70%-110%, you MUST suggest valid actions (don't skip).

ACTIONS YOU CAN TAKE:
1. SPLIT - Divide an over-capacity section (>110%) into two sections
   - Only split if each resulting section would have at least 40% of capacity
   - IMPORTANT: If a section is over 150%, consider ADD instead of SPLIT
2. MERGE - Combine TWO under-utilized sections (<70%) of the SAME COURSE
   - CRITICAL: Only merge sections with identical Course ID (e.g., "Math 1" with "Math 1")
   - NEVER merge different courses (e.g., cannot merge "Math 1" with "Math 2")
   - MUST specify exactly 2 section IDs in the "section_ids" array
   - Look at "ALL SECTIONS BY COURSE" above to find sections of the same course
   - AGGRESSIVELY merge any sections below 70%
   - Only merge if combined enrollment would be between 70%-110% of capacity
   - If only one section exists for a course and it's <70%, consider REMOVE instead
3. ADD - Create a new section for high-demand courses
   - Use when ANY section is over 120% capacity
   - PRIORITY for sections over 150% - these need immediate relief
   - CHECK: Ensure teachers in that department have available slots (see TEACHER LOADS)
   - VERIFY: Course has sufficient total demand to justify another section
4. REMOVE - Delete a section with very low enrollment
   - Remove ANY section below 65% utilization if no merge partner exists
   - For sections 65-70%: Remove if it's the only section of that course
   - Prefer MERGE when possible, but REMOVE is better than leaving low utilization sections
   - Check course has sufficient remaining capacity after removal
   - NEVER create a MERGE action with only one section - use REMOVE instead

CONSTRAINTS:
- Teachers can teach maximum {max_teacher_sections} sections
- Special courses must follow their period restrictions
- PRIORITY: Fix ALL sections below 70% utilization
- Take aggressive action - it's better to have fewer well-utilized sections

ACTION IMPACT ANALYSIS (use this to make better decisions):
- MERGE impact: Reduces section count, increases utilization of remaining section
- SPLIT impact: Increases section count, requires teacher with availability
- ADD impact: Increases total capacity, requires teacher with availability in that department
- REMOVE impact: Reduces total capacity, ensure remaining capacity > total enrollment

STRATEGY GUIDELINES:
1. First priority: Fix severely over-capacity sections (>130%) with ADD
2. Second priority: Merge under-utilized sections (<70%) of the same course
3. Third priority: Split moderately over-capacity sections (110-130%)
4. Last resort: Remove sections only if <65% and no merge partner exists

STABILITY RULES:
- Sections 65-70% with no merge partner: MUST be acted upon (usually remove)
- Don't split sections unless they're consistently over 120% utilized
- When adding sections, ensure there's sustained demand (multiple sections over capacity)
- Prefer conservative actions that won't need immediate reversal
- EDGE CASE: Single sections of a course at 65-70% should be removed or kept based on course importance

ANALYZE the sections and DECIDE which actions to take.

DECISION PROCESS:
1. Review DEPARTMENT SUMMARY to identify which departments have teacher capacity
2. Check ALL SECTIONS BY COURSE for utilization distribution per course
3. For each course with problems, analyze:
   - How many sections are in each utilization range
   - Whether course has overall capacity shortage or excess
   - Which teachers are assigned and their availability
4. Choose the SINGLE MOST IMPACTFUL action per course that:
   - Fixes the most sections
   - Considers teacher availability in that department
   - Won't create new problems
5. REMEMBER: Only ONE action per course allowed!

STRATEGIC THINKING:
- If a course has 3 sections at 50%, consider merging two (leaves one at 50%, one at 100%)
- If a course has 1 section at 140%, prefer ADD over SPLIT if department has teacher capacity
- If all teachers in a department are at capacity, avoid ADD actions for that department
- Check utilization_distribution to see the full picture before acting

Example: If Math 1 has two sections at 50% and one at 120%, merge the two 50% sections (one action for Math 1).

NEVER return invalid actions like:
- MERGE with only one section_id (this is INVALID - use REMOVE instead)
- Actions on sections that don't exist
- Multiple actions for the same course

SPECIAL CASE: If a course has only ONE section that needs action:
- If it's over capacity: Use SPLIT or ADD (not MERGE)
- If it's under capacity: Use REMOVE (not MERGE)

IMPORTANT: Before suggesting a MERGE action, verify both sections have the same Course ID.
Return a JSON list of actions in this format:

[
  {{
    "action": "SPLIT",
    "section_id": "S001",
    "reason": "120% utilization - splitting will create two sections at 60% each, both viable"
  }},
  {{
    "action": "MERGE", 
    "section_ids": ["S002", "S003"],
    "reason": "Both Math 1 sections at 40% utilization, combined will be 80% - optimal range"
  }},
  {{
    "action": "ADD",
    "course": "PE",
    "reason": "Section at 150% utilization needs relief, teachers T005 and T006 have available slots"
  }},
  {{
    "action": "REMOVE",
    "section_id": "S004",
    "reason": "Only 20% utilization (5/25 students), no merge partner, course has excess capacity"
  }}

Focus on the most impactful changes. Maximum {max_changes} actions.
