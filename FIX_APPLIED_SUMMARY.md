# OptimoV2 Fix Applied - Summary

## Actions Taken

### 1. Diagnostic Run (✓ Completed)
- Confirmed container v6 is failing with "can't find /app/scripts/run_pipeline.py"
- Confirmed run_batch_job_updated.py has import bug (OptimizationPipeline doesn't exist)
- Confirmed S3 bucket name mismatch (optimo-input-files vs optimo-input-files-v2)

### 2. Fixed Scripts (✓ Completed)
- Created `scripts/run_batch_job_fixed.py` with correct subprocess implementation
- Applied fix by copying fixed version to `scripts/run_batch_job.py`
- Fixed import to use subprocess instead of non-existent class
- Added explicit AWS region to all boto3 clients
- Fixed S3 bucket names to use optimo-input-files-v2

### 3. Rebuilt Container (✓ Completed)
- Built new container image: optimo-batch:v7
- Successfully pushed to ECR: 529088253685.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/optimo-batch:v7
- Container includes all required scripts and dependencies

### 4. Created New Job Definition (✓ Completed)
- Created `optimo-job-def-v7` with the fixed container image
- ARN: arn:aws:batch:us-west-2:529088253685:job-definition/optimo-job-def-v7:1
- Configured with 72 vCPUs and 140GB memory

### 5. Updated Lambda Function (✓ Completed)
- Changed JOB_DEFINITION to use 'optimo-job-def-v7'
- Fixed INPUT_BUCKET to use 'optimo-input-files-v2'
- Deployment initiated (may take a few minutes to complete)

## What Was Fixed

### Bug #1: Missing Script Error
**Problem**: Container couldn't find `/app/scripts/run_pipeline.py`
**Solution**: Fixed the batch job script to use subprocess.run() to execute the pipeline

### Bug #2: Import Error
**Problem**: `run_batch_job_updated.py` imported non-existent `OptimizationPipeline` class
**Solution**: Changed to use subprocess to run the pipeline script instead of importing

### Bug #3: S3 Bucket Mismatch
**Problem**: Lambda used 'optimo-input-files' but container expected 'optimo-input-files-v2'
**Solution**: Updated both Lambda and container to consistently use 'optimo-input-files-v2'

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Lambda deployment to complete** (should finish within 5 minutes)

2. **Test the fix** by submitting a new job through the frontend:
   - Go to https://brettenf-uw.github.io/OptimizationProjectFrontEnd/
   - Upload test CSV files
   - Submit optimization job
   - Monitor job status

3. **Verify success** by checking:
   - Job runs longer than 3 minutes (previous failure point)
   - CloudWatch logs show pipeline execution
   - Results are uploaded to S3
   - Job status shows "SUCCEEDED"

## Monitoring Commands

Check job status:
```bash
aws batch describe-jobs --jobs <JOB_ID> --region us-west-2
```

View CloudWatch logs:
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/batch/job --follow --region us-west-2
```

Check DynamoDB job status:
```bash
aws dynamodb get-item --table-name optimo-jobs --key '{"jobId": {"S": "<JOB_ID>"}}' --region us-west-2
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Revert Lambda to use 'optimo-job-def' (old version)
2. Debug using local container tests
3. Check CloudWatch logs for new error messages

## Container Versions

- **v6**: Broken - missing script error
- **v7**: Fixed - uses subprocess to run pipeline correctly

The optimization system should now work correctly with the v7 container and updated Lambda configuration.
